		age of empires 2 is one of my favorite games of all time. I first played it when I was very young, and didn't really
		understand what was happening, or how to play. I watched my dad, and after begging for a long time, I was finally allowed
		to play, and I played it for years. I remember sharing cheat codes around with my friends at school, and setting up lan
		games at our house, where we would all have to move the disk around from person to person to get the game started on every computer.
		</p><p>I stopped playing age of empires when I got older, I didn't really touch it through most of Jr high, and highschool, but when they remastered the game ( with the HD edition on steam) I picked it up right away, and enjoyed a bit of
		a nostalgia trip, before putting it away again. But when I got to college, I ended up playing it with a bunch of roommates,
		and I realized that there was a lot of depth to the game that I had always missed, and so I started looking up video tutorials
		for strategies, like fast castling, and archer rushing, and before I knew it, I had pounded 100 hours into the game. 
		</p><p>I don't play age of empires every day, or even every month anymore, but every once in a blue moon ill boot it up to 
		enjoy some random maps with friends, or to slaughter a bunch of AI's while I listen to a podcast or something.

	def Dishonored(self):
		return """<p>Dishonored probably wins the prize for "game that I have the most merch for". I love dishonored. It's a steampunky stealth
		first person RPG, and the first game that really got me into the "stealth games" genre. I really liked that you had the
		blink ability to move around the map, blinking from cover to cover, without being detected. this really made it more fun, because
		you could be agressivly stealthy, as you move around the map, and it combined really well with levels that had a great 
		deal of verticality, and a great climbing system, that let you really move around all three dimensions of a level. It 
		also had a ton of freedom to complete a mission in any way you could find. there was lots of ways to get around, and lots of 
		hidden secrets in levels, making it really fun to replay. and the world was mysterious, and beautifully depressing,
		taking place in a city that was in the midst of a plague, and it really shows, with soldiers patrolling areas, enforcing curfew, 
		or even a district full of the dead and dying, abandoned and flooded by the rest of the city.
		</p><p>if this wasn't a rough draft I would put a closing statement here, but instead here's a snarky line about how I will 
		definitely come back and finish this later ;)

	def DarkSouls(self):
		return """<p> Dark souls is another one of my favorite games/game serises. I originally tried playing 
		the first game in 2014, when I heard that it was a really good, and really hard game. the really
		hard part ended up being true, and I bounced off the game, quitting until 2016</p>
		</p> when I gave it a real try, I figured out exactly why so many people love the series. I would ragequit the game, and switch to watching a video or doing something unrelated, but 20 minutes later, I was back, giving it one more try, using some strategy that I hadn't thought of until then,
		or even using some "cheese" strat to try and defeat some particular boss, or area. (Shout out to the Capra Demon, which is still to this day one of the hardest boss fights for me)</p>
		<p> Although the interesting mechanics, and difficult are what drew me into the game, there is a lot more than that. 
		the storytelling style of dark souls is very "show, don't tell", and so you could probably finish the game without understanding anything but a very barebones definition of what the game is , or what is going on. There is so much story that is hidden off the beaten path, or 
		in item descriptions, which youtube channels have taken to analysing every tiny little detail, and sometimes it's hard to be sure if they've even got it right.
		<p> While the story is interesting, I also really enjoyed the mechanics of Dark Souls 1. It is clunky, and dated looking ( and even was back when it was released ) but swinging your weapon around felt satisfying, with a good weight to it. And all the enemies were just as strong as you. Pretty much every enemy in the game could probably kill you ( and would if you weren't careful. There was lots of different weapons to try, and each felt quite different, not just a copy pasted sword with a different skin. </p>
		<p> Another thing that really made Dark Souls (1 specifically) stand out to me was the locations. I loved running around a giant ruined world, with villages filled with warriors, and eventually discovering the giant city of Anor Londo. There were lots of different places, like darkroot garden ( a jungle-y garden area down below the undead burg ), and New Londo Ruins ( a giant flooded, ruined city filled with ghosts ). And one really cool thing that dark souls did, was connect most of the world together. climbing up through blighttown, a swampy area deep below everything, and making it to the surface only to realize that you're less than 100 feet from where you originally spawned in was a magical experience. </p>
		<p> </p>
		<p> Dark souls 3 is different from Dark souls 1 in some ways. For one thing it's a more modern game, and so it runs much nicer, but is also more intense. the newer engine allows the game to look really nice, and also to flow really well. Dark Souls 1 felt a bit clunky and slow at times, but dark souls 3 is the opposite, very loose and fast. I think that this made the combat much more challenging, but also a lot more fun. and with the updated graphics, everything in the game looks really beautiful. ( including your character for the first time in the series) the world looks really good, and the enemies look much nicer than a bunch of low poly zombies ( this time they are high poly zombies ) </p>
		<p> Dark souls 3 doesn't have the same level of connectivity in it's world that dark souls 1 is known for, the game is much more linear. There are some areas that are open to be explored, but generally it's pretty clear which way you need to go. While this is different from the first game, I don't think it's nessesairly a bad thing. One of the common bains of new players was accidentally walking into a late game area right off the bat, which dark souls 1 lets you do, and doesn;t even warn you about. This game is a little more forgiving, making it much harder for new players to get lost off the beaten path.</p>
		<p> In Conclusion, the dark souls series is my favorite game series ever. </p>
